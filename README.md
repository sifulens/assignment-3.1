Assignment criteria 
Please write a program which do following:

1) Create a dynamic array of strings.

2) Allow user to keep entering names until user enter "done", which indicates user entered all names.

2) Store the names in the dynamic array.

3) Initialize the dynamic array size to 4, double the array size once the array is filled up.

4) Display all the names

5) Ask user to enter a name and search. If that name is in the array, print out the index for that name

6) Create a function called expandArray, which doubles the size of the array when the its size reaches the limit

7) Create a function called printListwhich, which prints out all the names in the array

8) Create a function called findName, which searches if a given name is inside the array. Return the index of that number if it is in the array, return -1 if the number not found in the array. 

9) Create a function called removeName, which removes the given name in the array and resize the array. 

10) All functions include at least one parameter which receive the dynamic array by reference.
